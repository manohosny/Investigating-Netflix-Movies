README for Netflix Movie Analysis Script
Description
This Python script processes and visualizes data about movies available on Netflix. It reads a CSV containing Netflix data, focuses on movies specifically, and then visualizes movie durations based on their year of release. Movies from different genres are color-coded to easily distinguish them.

Prerequisites
Before you run the script, ensure you have the following:

Python (version 3.x recommended)
Required Python libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
You can install these using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib
Data Format
The script expects a CSV file named netflix_data.csv with the following columns:

title: Name of the movie.
type: Specifies if the entry is a movie or a TV show. For this script, we are only interested in entries with type "Movie".
country: Country where the movie was produced.
genre: Genre of the movie.
release_year: Year when the movie was released.
duration: Duration of the movie in minutes.
How to Run
Ensure you have the netflix_data.csv file in the same directory as the script.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
python name_of_the_script.py
Replace name_of_the_script.py with the name you've given to the script.

Visualization Description
The script produces a scatter plot showing the duration of movies against their release year. Movies are color-coded based on their genre:

Red: Children
Blue: Documentaries
Green: Stand-Up
Black: Other genres
The plot provides insights into how movie durations have changed over the years and if there are any specific trends related to certain genres.
